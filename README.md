# Employee Referral Landing Page

## Overview

The landing page is responsive – both mobile and desktop versions are available.

The Home and other pages are empty; the design is created for the landing page, which can be accessed through the menu by selecting "Refer Friends."
The menu highlights the currently active page.

Refer Friends includes a form with validation – it checks for invalid or empty email inputs.
The form is integrated with JSONBin, allowing the submission of different emails while preventing duplicate email entries.

The landing page also includes an expandable accordion row implemented with React/Motion.
